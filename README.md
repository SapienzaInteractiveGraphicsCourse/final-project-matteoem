# Important statement:
The mechanics that I tried to implement ARE extremely complex, unoptimized(for as it is now..) and very powerful. 
This brings along the major problem that if you force such mechanics,you will be able to break it. For that I implemented some respawn conditions to help the experience. 

NOTE: I'm aware of how the force imprinted to the companion cubes passing the portals is slightly unstable. Don't worry, the cubes will respawn in the same spot where you found it
if they will break through the wall of the map.

Thanks for trying this game,and remember...
